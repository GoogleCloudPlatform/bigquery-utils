# Google Cloud Build script to deploy bqutils UDFs in your own project
#
# This build script is used to unit test.sql the BigQuery UDFs for every
# change pushed to the udfs/ directory.
#
# Manual Execution:
# Use the below command to invoke the build manually. Note the substitutions for
# BRANCH_NAME and REVISION_ID. These variables are normally populated when the
# build is executed via build triggers but will be empty during manual
# execution. Dummy branch and revisions can be passed during manual execution so
# the artifacts can be uploaded upon build completion.
#
# gcloud builds submit . --substitutions _BQ_LOCATION=
