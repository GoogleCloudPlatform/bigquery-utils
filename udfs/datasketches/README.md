# Supporting Datasketches in BigQuery

Apache Datasketches for BigQuery is maintained in
the [apache/datasketches-bigquery](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-bigquery)
repo.

This project enhances Google BigQuery by integrating a suite of powerful sketch
functions from [Apache DataSketches](https://datasketches.apache.org/), enabling
efficient probabilistic data analysis on massive datasets.

Apache Datasketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic
streaming algorithms commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences. Sketches
are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream and can
provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to computationally
difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than traditional, exact methods.
