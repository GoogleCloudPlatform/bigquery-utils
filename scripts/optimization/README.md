# Optimization Scripts

This folder contains scripts that (when executed) create a dataset
named, `optimization_workshop`, with several tables inside the dataset. \
These tables are populated with information to help you optimize your BigQuery
tables, views, and queries.

Run all the .sql scripts within this folder using the following commands:

```bash
gcloud auth login &&
bash run_all_scripts.sh
```

The `anti-pattern-recognittion-tool-scripts` subfolder contains additional scripts that need to be executed separetly to run 
the [Anti-pattern Recognition Tool](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigquery-antipattern-recognition/tree/main): 
```bash
bash ./anti-pattern-recognittion-tool-scripts/run_anti_pattern_tool.sh \
--input_table_name="optimization_workshop.viewable_queries_grouped_by_hash" \
--input_table_id_col_name="Query_Hash" \
--input_table_query_text_col_name="Query_Raw_Sample" \
--input_table_slots_col_name="Total_Slot_Hours"

bash ./anti-pattern-recognittion-tool-scripts/run_anti_pattern_tool.sh \
--input_table_name="optimization_workshop.queries_grouped_by_hash_project" \
--input_table_id_col_name="query_hash" \
--input_table_query_text_col_name="top_10_jobs[SAFE_OFFSET(0)].query_text" \
--input_table_slots_col_name="avg_total_slots"
```

Te above command tales the `<dataset>.<tablename>` as input. In can be executed on any table with a schema similar to the one generated by `viewable_queries_grouped_by_hash`.

The scripts are described in more detail in the following sections.

# Project Analysis

Project level analysis enables us to understand key metrics such as slot_time,
bytes_scanned, bytes_shuffled and bytes_spilled on a daily basis within a
project. The metrics are examined as averages, medians and p80s. This enables us
to understand at a high level what jobs within a project consume 80% of the time
and 50% of the time daily.

<details><summary><b>&#128269; Daily project metrics</b></summary>

## Daily project metrics

The [daily_project_analysis.sql](daily_project_analysis.sql) script creates a
table called,
`daily_project_analysis` of daily slot consumption metrics (for a 30day period)
for all your projects.

### Examples of querying script results

* Top 100 tables with the highest slot consumption

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM optimization_workshop.daily_project_analysis
    ORDER BY total_slot_ms DESC
    LIMIT 100
    ```

# Table Analysis

<details><summary><b>&#128269; BigQuery Clustering/Partitioning Recommender Tool</b></summary>

## BigQuery Clustering/Partitioning Recommender Tool

The BigQuery partitioning and clustering recommender analyzes workflows on your
BigQuery tables and offers recommendations to better optimize your workflows and
query costs using either table partitioning or table clustering. The recommender
uses your BigQuery's workload execution data from the past 30 days to analyze
each BigQuery table for suboptimal partitioning and clustering configurations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you can view partition and cluster recommendations, you
> need to [enable the Recommender API](https://cloud.google.com/recommender/docs/enabling)
> as shown in the following sections.

### Enable using gcloud

```bash
# The following script retrieves all distinct projects from the JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION view
# and then enables the recommender API for each project.
projects=$(
  bq query \
    --nouse_legacy_sql \
    --format=csv \
    "SELECT DISTINCT project_id FROM \`region-us\`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION" \
    | sed 1d
);
for proj in $projects; do
  gcloud services --project="${proj}" enable recommender.googleapis.com &
done
```

### Enable using Terraform

```hcl
resource "google_project_service" "recommender_service" {
  project = "your-project"
  service = "recommender.googleapis.com"
}
```

### View your partition and cluster recommendations

Once you've enabled the Recommender API,
you can [view your partition and cluster recommendations](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/view-partition-cluster-recommendations#view_recommendations)
in the Cloud Console or via the gcloud command-line tool.

> [!NOTE]
> The most scalable method for viewing your partition and cluster
> recommendations is to export your recommendations to BigQuery. 
> You can do this by creating a Data Transfer Service (DTS) job to export your
> recommendations to BigQuery.
> See [Exporting recommendations to BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/recommender/docs/bq-export/export-recommendations-to-bq#create_a_data_transfer_for_recommendations)
> for more information.

Once you set up the DTS job to export your recommendations to BigQuery, you can 
run the following query to get the most recent recommendations for partitioning
and clustering your tables.

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION extract_table(target_resources ARRAY<STRING>) AS((
  SELECT ARRAY_AGG(
    REGEXP_REPLACE(REGEXP_EXTRACT(target_resource, r'\/projects\/(.*?\/datasets\/.*?\/tables\/.*)'), "(/datasets/|/tables/)", ".")
  ) 
  FROM UNNEST(target_resources) target_resource)[OFFSET(0)]
);
SELECT
  MAX(last_refresh_time) AS latest_recommendation_time,
  recommender_subtype AS recommendation,
  MAX_BY(JSON_VALUE_ARRAY(COALESCE(
    PARSE_JSON(recommendation_details).overview.partitionColumns,
    PARSE_JSON(recommendation_details).overview.clusterColumns)),
  last_refresh_time) AS columns_to_cluster_or_partition,
  extract_table(target_resources) AS table,
  bqutil.fn.table_url(extract_table(target_resources)) AS table_url,
  JSON_VALUE(PARSE_JSON(recommendation_details).overview.partitionTimeUnit) AS partition_time_unit,
-- Replace the table below with your own table that you created when you 
-- set up the DTS job to export your recommendations to BigQuery.
FROM YOUR_PROJECT.YOUR_DATASET.recommendations_export
WHERE recommender = "google.bigquery.table.PartitionClusterRecommender"
GROUP BY recommendation, table, partition_time_unit, table_url
```

<details><summary><b>&#128269; Tables with query read patterns</b></summary>

## Tables with query read patterns

The [table_read_patterns.sql](table_read_patterns.sql) script creates a table
named, `table_read_patterns`, that contains usage data to help you determine:

* Which tables (when queried) are resulting in high slot consumption.
* Which tables are most frequently queried.

### Examples of querying script results

## Tables without partitioning or clustering

The [tables_without_partitioning_or_clustering.sql](tables_without_partitioning_or_clustering.sql)
script creates a table named, `tables_without_part_clust`,
that contains a list of tables which meet any of the following conditions:

- not partitioned
- not clustered
- neither partitioned nor clustered

### Examples of querying script results

* Top 100 largest tables without partitioning or clustering

## Actively read tables with partitioning and clustering information

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [actively_read_tables_with_partitioning_clustering_info.sql](optimization/actively_read_tables_with_partitioning_clustering_info.sql) 
> script depends on the `table_read_patterns` table so you must first run the
> [table_read_patterns.sql](optimization/table_read_patterns.sql) script.

The [actively_read_tables_with_partitioning_clustering_info.sql](actively_read_tables_with_partitioning_clustering_info.sql)
script creates a table named, `actively_read_tables_with_part_clust_info`
that contains a list of actively read tables along with their partitioning and
clustering information.

### Examples of querying script results

* Top 100 largest **actively read** tables without partitioning or clustering

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM optimization_workshop.actively_read_tables_with_part_clust_info

## Tables receiving high quantity of daily DML statements

The [frequent_daily_table_dml.sql](frequent_daily_table_dml.sql) script creates
a table named, `frequent_daily_table_dml`, that contains tables that have had
more than 24 daily DML statements run against them in the past 30 days.

### Examples of querying script results

* Top 100 tables with the most DML statements per table in a day

  ```sql
  SELECT
    table_id,
    table_url,

## Views with non-optimal JOIN conditions

The [views_with_nonoptimal_join_condition.sql](views_with_nonoptimal_join_condition.sql)
script creates a table named, `views_with_nonoptimal_join_condition`, that
contains views with JOINs where the JOIN condition is potentially non-optimal.

</details>

<details><summary><b>&#128269; Storage Billing Model Savings DDL </b></summary>

## Storage Billing Model Savings DDL

The [storage_billing_model_savings_ddl.sql](storage_billing_model_savings_ddl.sql) script
creates a table named, `storage_billing_model_savings_ddl` which forecasts which datasets will benefit from
either the physical or logical storage billing model, and provides the DDL to adjust them across your organization.

Instructions: Search for marker 'REMEMBER' to tune the queries at your will. You must adjust the region that you're interested in
and the pricing for each region found [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#storage).

### Examples of querying script results

* Top 10 datasets with their respective recommended storage billing model, ordered by forecasted savings

  ```sql
  SELECT project_name, dataset_name, currently_on, better_on, monthly_savings, ddl
  FROM optimization_workshop.storage_billing_model_savings_ddl
  ORDER BY monthly_savings DESC
  LIMIT 10

# Query Analysis

<details><summary><b>&#128269; Queries grouped by hash</b></summary>

## Queries grouped by hash

The [queries_grouped_by_hash.sql](queries_grouped_by_hash.sql) script creates a
table named,
`queries_grouped_by_hash`. This table groups queries by their normalized query
pattern, which ignores
comments, parameter values, UDFs, and literals in the query text.
This allows us to group queries that are logically the same, but
have different literals. The `queries_grouped_by_hash` table does not expose the
raw SQL text of the queries.

The [viewable_queries_grouped_by_hash.sql](viewable_queries_grouped_by_hash.sql)
script creates a table named,
`viewable_queries_grouped_by_hash`. This table is similar to
the `queries_grouped_by_hash` table, but it
exposes the raw SQL text of the queries.
The `viewable_queries_grouped_by_hash.sql` script runs much slower
in execution than the `queries_grouped_by_hash.sql` script because it has to
loop over all projects and for each
project query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT` view.

For example, the following queries would be grouped together because the date
literal filters are ignored:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE date = '2020-01-01';
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE date = '2020-01-02';
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE date = '2020-01-03';
```

Running the `run_anti_pattern_tool.sh` bash script will build and run the Anti-Pattern Recognition tool and output the results to the `viewable_queries_grouped_by_hash` table in the `recommendation` column. The tool will identify syntaxes that are know to frequently cause performance issues. 

### Examples of querying script results

* Top 100 queries with the highest bytes processed

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM optimization_workshop.queries_grouped_by_hash
  ORDER BY total_gigabytes_processed DESC
  LIMIT 100
  ```

* Top 100 recurring queries with the highest slot hours consumed

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM optimization_workshop.queries_grouped_by_hash
  ORDER BY total_slot_hours * days_active * job_count DESC 
  LIMIT 100
  ```

</details>

<details><summary><b>&#128269; Queries grouped by script</b></summary>

## Queries grouped by script

The [queries_grouped_by_script.sql](queries_grouped_by_script.sql) script
creates a table named,
`queries_grouped_by_script`. This table groups queries by their parent job id
which means that any queries that
were executed as part of a script (multi-statement query) will be grouped
together. This table is helpful if you
want to see which particular scripts are most inefficient.

### Examples of querying script results

* Top 100 scripts with the highest bytes processed

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM optimization_workshop.queries_grouped_by_script
  ORDER BY total_gigabytes_processed DESC
  LIMIT 100
  ```

* Top 100 scripts with the highest slot hours consumed

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM optimization_workshop.queries_grouped_by_script
  ORDER BY total_slot_hours DESC
  LIMIT 100
  ```

* Top 100 scripts with the highest slot hours consumed that doesn't include
  INFO_SCHEMA views

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM optimization_workshop.queries_grouped_by_script
  WHERE NOT EXISTS(
    SELECT 1
    FROM UNNEST(referenced_tables) table
    WHERE table LIKE "INFORMATION_SCHEMA%"
  )
  ORDER BY total_slots DESC
  LIMIT 100

## Queries grouped by labels

The [queries_grouped_by_labels.sql](queries_grouped_by_labels.sql) script
creates a table named,
`queries_grouped_by_labels`. This table groups queries by their labels 
(after formatting all labels as a STRUCT string) which allows you to analyze
different groups of queries based on their labels.

</details>
