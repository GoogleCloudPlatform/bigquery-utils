# Google Cloud Build script for bqutils
#
# This build script is used to deploy the open-source bqutil GitHub repository
# for every change pushed.
#
# Manual Execution:
# Use the below command to invoke the build manually. Note the substitutions for
# BRANCH_NAME and REVISION_ID. These variables are normally populated when the
# build is executed via build triggers but will be empty during manual
# execution. Dummy branch and revisions can be passed during manual execution so
# the artifacts can be uploaded upon build completion.
#
# gcloud builds submit . --config=cloudbuild.yaml
