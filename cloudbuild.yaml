# Google Cloud Build script for bqutils
#
# This build script is used to deploy the open-source bqutil GitHub repository
# for every change pushed.
#
# Manual Execution:
# Use the below command to invoke the build manually. Note the substitutions for
# BRANCH_NAME and REVISION_ID. These variables are normally populated when the
# build is executed via build triggers but will be empty during manual
# execution. Dummy branch and revisions can be passed during manual execution so
# the artifacts can be uploaded upon build completion.
#
# gcloud builds submit . --config=cloudbuild.yaml
#

  # Fetches master branch from GitHub and then hard "resets"
  # to the _PR_NUMBER which triggered this build. This enables
  # build.sh to build only what's changed relative to the
  # master branch by checking the output of "git diff".
